Hi Professor!
Run python folder_perspective_shift.py to run the code on an entire dataset

The program will default to DeepAccident_type1_subtype2_normal which is included in the repository.

It will ouput a file with the average time for perspective transformation, total tiem for dataset, standard deviation, and 99th percentile latency.
