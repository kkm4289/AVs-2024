Hi Professor!

Run `python folder_perspective_shift.py` to run the code on an entire dataset.

The program will default to `DeepAccident_type1_subtype2_normal` ~~which is included in the repository~~. (There were several issues uploading the data to GitHub, so instead, it can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1It80guGKlI1OdztJpfWFcQt4DWYjUqjG?usp=sharing)

It will output a file with the average time for the perspective transformation, total time for the dataset, standard deviation, and 99th percentile latency.
